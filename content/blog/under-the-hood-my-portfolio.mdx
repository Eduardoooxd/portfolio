# Under the Hood: Exploring the Technologies Powering My Portfolio

<section className="space-y-4 mt-4"> 
  <p>
    As developers, our portfolios serve as both our digital business cards and playgrounds for
    implementing best practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this article, I'll walk you through the technology stack behind my own <a href="https://github.com/Eduardoooxd/portfolio" className="underline" target="_blank"> my portfolio website</a>,
    explaining the key choices that make it robust, maintainable, and performant.
  </p>
</section>

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js & React**: The foundation of the website, enabling server-side rendering and a dynamic user experience. Next.js's file-based routing and React's component-based architecture facilitate efficient development and maintenance.

- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and enhances code quality, making the development process more robust and error-free.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides utility-first CSS classes that streamline the styling process, resulting in a responsive and visually appealing design.

- **Resend**: Manages email functionalities, ensuring reliable communication through contact forms.

- **Playwright**: Utilized for end-to-end testing, ensuring the website's functionality and performance meet the highest standards.

- **Vercel**: Hosts the website, offering seamless deployment and scalability, I can simply just link my Github Repo and it will automaticly deploy new changes.

## Key Features

### Project Showcase

The portfolio highlights various projects, each demonstrating different aspects of my development skills:

- **Aquapharma**: A responsive website developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, designed to showcase a health company's portfolio and facilitate user contact submissions.

- **Delfim Maia**: A freelancing project for a law firm, featuring internationalization (i18n) support and a content management system (CMS) for client updates.

- **AntiRecurso**: An open-source learning platform where I was responsible for graphical representation of student grades and implementing dark mode support.

- **Orun**: An e-commerce website integrated with Shopify, supporting internationalization and features like payments and newsletters.

### Contact Form

The contact form is powered by Resend, ensuring that messages are delivered securely and promptly. This feature allows visitors to reach out directly, facilitating networking and collaboration opportunities.

```ts
const resend = new Resend(RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function contactFormAction(formData: unknown) {
  const parsedFormData = ContactFormSchema.safeParse(formData);

  if (!parsedFormData.success) {
    return {
      error: parsedFormData.error.flatten().fieldErrors,
    };
  }

  const { data } = parsedFormData;
  const { email: senderEmail, message, name } = data;

  try {
    const response = await resend.emails.send({
      from: RESEND_FROM_EMAIL,
      to: RESEND_TO_EMAIL,
      subject: 'Message from Contact Form ðŸ”¥',
      text: `Name: ${name}\nEmail: ${senderEmail}\nMessage: ${message}`,
      reply_to: senderEmail,
      react: React.createElement(ContactFormEmail, { senderEmail, message, name }),
    });

    return {
      response,
    };
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    return {
      error,
    };
  }
}
```

### Testing and Quality Assurance

To maintain high code quality and functionality, the project employs Playwright for end-to-end testing and Husky for pre-commit hooks

```ts
test.describe('Landing Page', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to the base URL before each test
    await page.goto('/');
  });

  test('Should have the appropriate page title', async ({ page }) => {
    await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Eduardo Couto - Full Stack Software Developer/);
  });

  //...

  test('Should submit the Contact form successfully', async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to the Contact section
    await page.goto('/#contact');

    // Fill the form
    await page.getByTestId('contact-name-input').pressSequentially('John Doe');
    await page.getByTestId('contact-email-input').fill('john.doe@example.com');
    await page.getByTestId('contact-message-input').fill('Hello, This is a test message.');

    // Click the submit button
    await page.click('text=Submit');

    const toastContainer = page.getByTestId('toast-container');
    // Verify submission success message or redirection
    await expect(toastContainer).toBeVisible();
    await expect(toastContainer).toContainText('Email sent successfully!');
  });
```

Where afterwards I'm running the e2e tests on Github Actions Pipelines

```yaml
jobs:
  e2e-tests:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install pnpm ${{ vars.PNPM_VERSION }}
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: ${{ vars.PNPM_VERSION }}

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ vars.NODE_VERSION }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ vars.NODE_VERSION }}
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: Install project dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: pnpm e2e:test
        env:

          RESEND_FROM_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL }}
          RESEND_TO_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.RESEND_TO_EMAIL }}
          NODE_ENV: development
          NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY: ${{ secrets.POSTHOG_KEY }}
          NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST: ${{ vars.POSTHOG_HOST }}
          NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV: development

      - name: Publish Playwright CTRF Detailed Test Summary Results
        if: always()
        run: npx github-actions-ctrf tests playwright-report/ctrf-report.json

      - name: Upload Playwright report

        if: always()
        with:

```
