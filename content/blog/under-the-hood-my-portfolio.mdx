# Under the Hood: Exploring the Technologies Powering My Portfolio

<p class="mt-10">
  Hello everybody, in this post I aim to share insights and experiences from my journey as a
  software developer.
</p>

Today, I want to pull back the curtain and discuss the technologies that form the foundation of my
online portfolio, a central hub showcasing my projects, skills, and professional journey

My goal was to build an efficient and scalable portfolio using modern tools and practices, and the technologies I'll describe are instrumental in achieving that objective.
