# Eduardo Couto's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a software developer. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), this portfolio highlights my journey and the work I am passionate about.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying src/app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
```

## Technical Documentation

This section provides an overview of the technical aspects of the project.
